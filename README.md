This project is for the simulation of a 2D ising model (by Metropolis monte carlo algorithm) to study its properties.


# 2D Ising Model Simulations
*All the simulation codes are using single spin flip dynamics only.* 

-Folder `2DIsing_criticalexponents` contains MATLAB files (.m) for generating the plots of critical exponenets vs Lattice Size.

-Folder `2DIsing_Fs` contains code files for estimating surface tension by method of probabality distribution.

-Folder `2DIsing_phasetransition` contains code files for generating the plots of Average magnetisation, Average Energy, susceptibility and heat capacity vs Temperature.

-Folder `2DIsing_probability_distribution` contains code files for estimating distribution of 2D ising states by varying order parameter and using simple counting method.

-Folder `2DIsing_correlations` contains code files for estimating correlation function with respect to distance 'r' from the middle most spin (pseudo middle spin in even lattice dimension).
